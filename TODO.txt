*) bbcode
	All codes seen now supported.  Need to create a "kitchen sink"
	text from the editor to be sure we have everything.

*) Ensure all guid_url values are valid:
	*) In some cases we have only url = 'showthread.php?t=53456'
	   or url = 'showthread.php/53456-<title>'

	   i.e. no actual post ID, and the thread IDs aren't the
	   same/valid on XF2.

	   To fix this we have to do a forum search on the thread title
	   in order to find the appropriate post to then look up the
	   *post* ID to fix the guid_url.
	   Ah, except *some* thread IDs *are* valid, so could be used to
	   automate some of this cleanup.
	   Check against
	   https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/<threadid>/ and if that
	   loads then grab the postid of the first post and use that in
	   new guid_url.
	   It's possible others might have been deleted.

   And make sure the search output is using these guid_url values so
   they'll actually work on the new forum!

   Likewise we might want to update any forum URLs in post content to be
   the proper format and a valid postid.

   See:

   SELECT id,url,guid_url FROM posts WHERE url NOT LIKE 'showthread.php/t=%p=%' AND url NOT LIKE 'showthread.php?p=%#post%' AND url NOT LIKE 'showthread.php?t=%&p=%' AND url NOT LIKE 'showthread.php/%-%?p=%#post%' ORDER BY id ASC;
   (1311 rows)

   Need to be things like:

   Should just be a case of switching from using 'url' to 'guid_url' in
   search output.

*) Last pre-XF2 posts.id is 30096

*) Ensure search works and its output is sane, i.e. URLs are in valid
formats to be useful.

*) Check any feed changes against:

	1) Tiny Tiny RSS (remember same-guid's in different feed get the
	same read/new state).
	2) miggy IRC bot
	3) Feedly
	4) EDCD feedbot -> "show_sample_entry.py" script with the URL:
	https://github.com/freiheit/discord_feedbot

*) 'Everything' into the config file, no hard coded 'config' values.
*) ED::DevTracker::Forums.pm to hold all the forum interaction code,
i.e. login, URL retrieval...
