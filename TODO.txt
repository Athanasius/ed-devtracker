1) Once we have access use

	Want to do this by viewing literally just the single post if
	possible.  This may no longer be supported however.

So full thread scraping it is:
	https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/372917-Speculation-Open-Beta?p=5854315#post5854315
	<a name="post5854315" href="showthread.php/372917-Speculation-Open-Beta?p=5854315&amp;viewfull=1#post5854315" class="postcounter">#12</a>
which is contained fully in:
	<li class="postbitlegacy postbitim postcontainer old" id="post_5854315" data-post-type="employee">

ALSO, consider trying this, instead of activity lists:

https://aw.my.com/en/forum/search.php?do=finduser&adm=6,21&contenttype=vBForum_Post&showposts=1&forumchoice%5B%5D=23&childforums=1

Note the multiple IDs passed as adm=6,21

*) ED::DevTracker::Forums.pm to hold all the forum interaction code,
i.e. login, URL retrieval...
