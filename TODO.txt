*) Ensure all guid_url values are valid:
	*) In some cases we have only url = 'showthread.php?t=53456'
	   or url = 'showthread.php/53456-<title>'

	   i.e. no actual post ID, and the thread IDs aren't the
	   same/valid on XF2.

	   To fix this we have to do a forum search on the thread title
	   in order to find the appropriate post to then look up the
	   *post* ID to fix the guid_url.
	   Ah, except *some* thread IDs *are* valid, so could be used to
	   automate some of this cleanup.
	   Check against
	   https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/<threadid>/ and if that
	   loads then grab the postid of the first post and use that in
	   new guid_url.
	   It's possible others might have been deleted.

   And make sure the search output is using these guid_url values so
   they'll actually work on the new forum!

   Likewise we might want to update any forum URLs in post content to be
   the proper format and a valid postid.

   See:

   SELECT id,url,guid_url FROM posts WHERE url NOT LIKE 'showthread.php/t=%p=%' AND url NOT LIKE 'showthread.php?p=%#post%' AND url NOT LIKE 'showthread.php?t=%&p=%' AND url NOT LIKE 'showthread.php/%-%?p=%#post%' ORDER BY id ASC;

1) Once we have access use

to spot new dev accounts.

*) 'Click Through' to full post content.
	Want to do this by viewing literally just the single post if
	possible.  This may no longer be supported however.
	Not working:
		https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?action=showpost&postid=5820343
		showpost.php seems to just be a redirect to showthread.php

So full thread scraping it is:
	https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/372917-Speculation-Open-Beta?p=5854315#post5854315
	<a name="post5854315" href="showthread.php/372917-Speculation-Open-Beta?p=5854315&amp;viewfull=1#post5854315" class="postcounter">#12</a>
which is contained fully in:
	<li class="postbitlegacy postbitim postcontainer old" id="post_5854315" data-post-type="employee">

ALSO, consider trying this, instead of activity lists:

https://aw.my.com/en/forum/search.php?do=finduser&adm=6,21&contenttype=vBForum_Post&showposts=1&forumchoice%5B%5D=23&childforums=1

Note the multiple IDs passed as adm=6,21

	1) 'Source' on full-text quotes needs to be made an absolute
	URL, else they'll point to e.g.
		https://miggy.org/games/elite-dangerous/devtracker-dev/showthread.php?p=5892514&viewfull=1#post5892514
	OR is this only an issue with testing in a .html file ?

	2) May need to put some in-line style="" in to get things
	formatted properly.
		<div class="bbcode_quote" style="margin: 0 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 2px; border: 1px solid #999;">
	NOPE, readers strip this. Instead I need to change the
		<div class="bbcode_quote ...>...</div>
	into
		<blockquote>...</blockquote>

	3) Remove 'aria-hidden' attribute on <i/> element:
		<i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>

	4) Remove
		<img alt="View Post" class="inlineimg" src="https://forums-cdn.frontier.co.uk/images/elite/buttons/viewpost-right.png" />

*) Check any feed changes against:

	1) Tiny Tiny RSS (remember same-guid's in different feed get the
	same read/new state).
	2) miggy IRC bot
	3) Feedly
	4) EDCD feedbot -> "show_sample_entry.py" script with the URL:
	https://github.com/freiheit/discord_feedbot

*) 'Everything' into the config file, no hard coded 'config' values.
*) ED::DevTracker::Forums.pm to hold all the forum interaction code,
i.e. login, URL retrieval...
