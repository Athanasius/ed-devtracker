   What is this?
  </h2>
  <p>

  If you're a fan of <a href="http://www.elitedangerous.com/">Elite:
  Dangerous</a> then you may also follow the <a
  href="http://frontier.co.uk/">Frontier Developments</a> <a
  href="http://forums.frontier.co.uk/">forums</a>.  If you do that
  then you may be frustrated at the lack of an easy way to see just the
  developer posts.
  </p>
  <p>
   Your response then might be to write a scraper to form an <a
   href="../devposts.html">RSS feed</a> of the posts.
  </p>
  <p>
   You might then eventually decide that rather than doing direct SQL
   queries on the database perhaps you should write a small web page to
   allow anyone to search the 'precis' text of each post.  That would be
   what this page is for.
  </p>
  <p>
  NB: The feed is updated at most every 5 minutes, more slowly if the
  forums are especially busy.  Thus there's no point polling this feed
  more often than every 5 minutes.  Also the output contains the last 7 days
  worth of posts, so if you check the feed any less frequently than that
  you will miss posts.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Caveat 1</b> - This feed will only contain the fully public
  posts from the forums, i.e. nothing from the Private Backers Forum or
  the Alpha Backers Forum.  Also you'll see <i>all Frontier Developments
  forum posts, not just those relating to Elite: Dangerous.</i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>Caveat 2</b> - Each post in this feed will be as it is seen on the
   appropriate member profile page's "Activity List".  That means you'll
   only ever see the new text (only a portion of it for longer posts),
   and never any quoted text.  To gather the quoted text and/or full
   posts would take an extra page load per item which would add to the
   load that the scraper causes on the forum.  I already go to some
   lengths to lighten the impact the scraper has on the forums,
   especially during those times the forums are under high load, and
   wouldn't want to upset the moderators by causing more of an issue.
