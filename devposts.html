  <h1>Now collecting new posts on new forums</h1>
  <p>
   As I type this it is 2019-04-08 and the Frontier forums have been up
   again on the XenForo v2 version for 11 days.  Sadly it turned out
   that the 'Dev Feed' has two problems:
   <ol>
    <li>
      The "<a href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/find-threads/staffpost">Staff / Developer Posts</a>" is only listing threads that 'dev's <i>started</i>, and in order of the last reply by anyone on them.
    </li>
    <li>
     Even given that issue, there's currently no RSS output for that
     URL.
    </li>
   </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    So I felt obligated to update my scraper to work against the new
    forums.  In some ways this proved to be easier than for the old site
    (e.g. consistent Content-Type of utf8, instead of randomly changing, so no
    hacks required to deal with that).  I have also been given a key for
    the XF2 API which makes retrieving some of the data cleaner, with
    less load on the forums servers.
  </p>
  <p>
   For historical purposes I'll keepo the three archives of the pre-XF2 posts available:
   <ol>
    <li>
     Postgresql 'pg_dump --format=plain': <a href="devtracker/archives/athan-ed-dev-rss-archive-20190325.sql.gz">athan-ed-dev-rss-archive-20190325.sql.gz</a>
    </li>
    <li>
     RSS, precis text only: <a href="devtracker/archives/athan-ed-dev-rss-archive-20190325.rss.gz">athan-ed-dev-rss-archive-20190325.rss.gz</a>
    </li>
    <li>
     RSS, fulltext: <a href="devtracker/archives/athan-ed-dev-rss-fulltext-archive-20190325.rss.gz">athan-ed-dev-rss-archive-20190325.rss.gz</a>
    </li>
   </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>
   What is this?
  </h2>
  <p>
  If you're a fan of <a href="http://www.elitedangerous.com/">Elite:
  Dangerous</a> then you may also follow the
  <a href="http://frontier.co.uk/">Frontier Developments</a> <a
  href="http://forums.frontier.co.uk/">forums</a>.  If you do that then you may be
  frustrated at the lack of an easy way to see just the developer
  posts.
  </p>
  <p>
  You could learn who they are and check around their profile pages
  manually now and then.
  </p>
  <p>
  You could write a <a href="https://elitedevtracker.com/">simple scraper that aggregates all the known
  developer posts onto one page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  Or you could decide that you much prefer an <a
  href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification">RSS feed</a>, so write a
  scraper and RSS output for it all.  That's what I did.  I even ended
  up making an additional feed with the full "clicked-through" text of
  each post.
  </p>
  <h2>
   How do I get it?
  </h2>
  <p>
  If your web browser is set up with an RSS feed extension then you
  should see the RSS icon up in your URL bar.  Simply click on that and
  get on with adding one of the feeds to your reader.
  </p>
  <p>
  NB: The feeds are updated at most every 5 minutes, more slowly if the
  forums are especially busy.  Thus there's no point polling these feeds
  more often than every 5 minutes.  Also the output contains the last 7 days
  worth of posts, so if you check the feed any less frequently than that
  you will miss posts.
  </p>
  <p>
  If for some reason you need to enter a feed manually, then these are
  the URLs:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    The legacy 'precis text only' feed - <a href="https://ed.miggy.org/devtracker/ed-dev-posts.rss">https://ed.miggy.org/devtracker/ed-dev-posts.rss</a>
   </li>
   <li>
    The newer 'full text' feed - <a href="https://ed.miggy.org/devtracker/ed-dev-posts-fulltext.rss">https://ed.miggy.org/devtracker/ed-dev-posts-fulltext.rss</a>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   <b>Caveat 1</b> - The feeds will only contain the fully public
  posts from the forums, i.e. nothing from the Private Backers Forum or
  the Alpha Backers Forum.  Also you'll see <i>all Frontier Developments
  forum posts, not just those relating to Elite: Dangerous, <b>unless I
  got around to blacklisting a particular non-ED forum</b>.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Caveat 2</b> - Each post in the 'precis text only' feed will be as it is seen on the
   appropriate member profile page's "Activity List".  That means you'll
   only ever see the new text (only a portion of it for longer posts),
   and never any quoted text.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 'full text' feed will usually contain full text, including any
   quotes, from the relevant post.  Sometimes it may have fallen back to
   just the precis text.  This would happen if the 'click-through' to
   retrieve the full post text failed.  Instead of failing the whole
   post, and possibly missing one entirely, I decided to store, and use,
   at least what I could.
  <p>
   <b>Caveat 3</b> - I have specifically chosen to not include the QA-*
   or Support-* accounts in my scraping, as they seldom post anything of
   much value (to anyone but who they're replying to).
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Caveat 4</b> - Each post will be as it appeared on the forums at
   the time the scraper first saw it.  Posts in the RSS feed are never
   updated for later edits.
  </p>
  <h2>Searching</h2>
  <p>
    There's a search available on <a href="devtracker/">the main feed
    page</a>.  Or maybe you're curious about <a
    href="devtracker/frontier-dev-latest-post-times.html">the latest
    seen and scraped post for each tracked developer</a>. This will
    update after each run of the collector script (so currently every 5
    minutes)
  </p>
  <h2>
   Who are you?
  </h2>
  <p>
  I go by the name 'Athanasius' online, and indeed I'm 'Cmdr Athanasius'
  in Elite: Dangerous.  You'll also find me as 'Athan' on <a
  href="https://www.quakenet.org/">QuakeNet</a>'s
  <a href="http://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=elite-dangerous&uio=d4">#elite-dangerous</a>
  and on the <a

  Forums</a>.

  <h1>
   News
  </h1>
  <p><u>2019-04-08 10:56 UTC</u><br />
   Now scraping against the XF2 forums for the live feed.  There's still
   a little fix up that needs doing on some historical posts (where they
   started a thread, rather than being a reply) to have the URLs point
   to the actual thread on the new forums, rather than "Not Found".
  </p>
  <p>
   Other than that everything should be working again, including the
   search interface (although with a double '/' in some URLs for now,
   which is harmless).
  </p>
  <p><u>2019-03-25 11:00 UTC</u><br />
   The old forums are now down for the move to the new forums.  I've
   stopped my scraper from running and will shortly make archives of the
   posts so far available.
  </p>
  <p><u>2018-07-13 15:30 UTC</u><br />
   I've added "Off-Topic Discussion" to the list of ignored forums, for
   what should be obvious reasons.
  </p>
  <p><u>2018-06-12 16:50 UTC</u><br />
   All of the new JWE related forums are now on the ignore list.  A
   bunch got added for the game launch, so a few posts leaked into this
   RSS feed.
  </p>
  <p><u>2018-03-28 15:45 UTC</u><br />
   I've just implemented ignoring of selected forums.  This is initially
   the current four "Jurassic World: Evolution" forums. Once I'm
   confident this is working without causing issues I may expand that
   list so that any forum not specific to ED is ignored.
  </p>
  <p><u>2018-02-03 22:53 UTC</u><br />
   I've removed 'Dale Emasiri' from the scraping as he's no longer
   working at Frontier.
  </p>
  <p><u>2017-11-06 13:50 UTC</u><br />
   I've just removed Drew Wagar from the monitored forum accounts.  He's
   no longer actively writing for ED and his posts aren't really
   relevant to the game any more.  Someone let me know if this changes
   and I'll consider adding him back.
  </p>
  <p><u>2017-10-10 16:53 UTC</u><br />
   Updated all the URLS to utilise https://ed.miggy.org/ instead of
   https://miggy.org/games/elite-dangerous/
  </p>
  <p><u>2017-09-21 09:15 UTC</u><br />
   The new 'full text' feed hasn't shown any issues in over a week of
   testing, so it's now described and linked to on this page.
  </p>
  <p><u>2017-06-05 20:05 UTC</u><br />
   Added Lloyd Morgan-Moore (157490) to the scraped forum accounts.
  </p>
  <p><u>2017-03-10 17:20 UTC</u><br />
   I've just finished work to use what I hope are truly unique
   <strong>and static</strong> GUIDs for each post.  Before this change
   if someone on the Frontier Forums edited the title of a topic then the
   scraper would use the changed URL as the permaLink and thus put it
   out as an additional new post.  Where several posts had already been
   made within the topic this would cause spam after the edit.
  </p>
  <p>I now strip out the embedded topic title from the URL, using just
  those parts that are necessary to reach it on the forums.  A
  side-effect of setting this up is that the feed just got spammed with
  a huge amount of not-actually-new posts due to changing over to using
  these better GUIDs in the permaLink property of each post.  This will
  be a one-off thing.
  </p>
  <p><u>2016-12-01 02:49 UTC</u><br />
   Changed the behaviour of the scraper so it no longer takes the
   <em>first</em> known post it sees as evidence that it is up to date
   for that forum member's activity.  It will still mean skipping that
   individual post, but it will continue to check all other posts
   visible on the activity page.  <strong>NB: This assumes there'll be
   no more than 50 posts on an Activity List at any one time, else it
   will think additional ones are new.</strong>
  </p>

  <p><u>2016-12-01 02:49 UTC</u><br />
  Removed Greg Ryder from the list of monitored accounts, as apparently
  he's been gone from Frontier for over a year now.
  </p>

  <p><u>2016-11-15 13:28 UTC</u><br />
  I've just added Drew Wagar to the monitored forum posters.  He's the
  author of one of the official books and driver of the 'Formidine Rift'
  mystery.  He doesn't seem to post too much, but when he does it's
  likely about said mystery.
  </p>

  <p><u>2016-08-26 15:12 UTC</u><br />
  I've just changed the code to strip the topic titles out of posts
  URLs.  If they change, and they can with a moderator edit, the code
  would see all the posts in that thread as new again.  This is what
  happened over the past day or so with the "The Galaxy - Is its size
  now considered to be a barrier to gameplay by the Developers?" thread
  in "Dangerous Discussion".
  </p>

  <p><u>2016-08-13 09:41 UTC</u><br />
  I've now removed Ben Parry from the collector.  He only ever posts in
  there Star Citizen thread now.
  </p>

  <p><u>2016-06-12 18:50 UTC</u><br />
  The issue with the post URLs seems to have been fixed.
  </p><p>
  Do note that because the URLs now include the thread title in text
  form it means my scraper has seen a lot of older posts as now-new, as
  it uses exactly that URL to know if it's seen a post before.  So
  there's been a splurge of ~50 posts repeated in the feed.
  </p>

  <p><u>2016-06-12</u><br />
  There have been some forum changes that are breaking my scraper. I've
  got code to work around one (putting text like " 4 replies and 242
  views" inside the element of class=date). But the links in the
  Activity Lists are now also broken, not properly containing the anchor
  to the specific post within the thread.
  </p><p>
  I've PM'd BrettC about both and hopefully he'll fix things.
  </p>

  <p><u>2016-05-05 00:41 UTC</u><br/>
   All URLs have been changed to use https://miggy.org/... rather than
   http://www.miggy.org/.  You may want to update your RSS readers.  The
   certificate for HTTPS/SSL is from LetsEncrypt and includes a full
   enough chain of Certificate Authorities that it should validate in
   any modern, up to date, web browser.
  </p>
  <p><u>2016-05-05 00:17 UTC</u><br/>
   Added " (&lt;Forum Name&gt;)" text to the end of item titles.  This
   will only be the sub-forum name, but in most cases should help with
   things like knowing if a post is in an Xbox forum, or a more general
   one.
  </p>
  <p><u>2015-07-02 19:00 BST</u><br/>
   As the QA-* accounts mostly seem to post things like "thanks for that
   report", and otherwise things that aren't all that relevant I've
   decided to no longer scrape them for this feed.  Note that FD do now
   seem to be pushing patch notes/changlogs to <a
   href="https://community.elitedangerous.com/patch-notes">the Community
   Site</a>, and that page has its own RSS feed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Any posts I'd already scraped for QA-* accounts will stay in the
   database but no new ones will appear.  Also, lack of probably
   usefulness is why I've not added the Support-* accounts either.
  </p>
  <p><u>2015-06-16 00:00 BST</u><br/>
   I've just finished putting together a very basic <a href="devtracker/">Search
   Interface</a> for the 'precis' text of all the posts in the database
   that drives this RSS feed.  Any feedback appreciated through the
   usual channels.
  </p>
  <p><u>2015-06-12 16:04 BST</u><br/>
  A small tweak to the scraping code means white space in posts is no
  longer collapsed, this will preserve the formatting where a post
  contains multiple paragraphs, bullet points etc.<br/>
  Past posts will remain 'broken' in this respect.
  </p>
  <p><u>2015-06-12 15:45 BST</u><br/>
  Tweaked the output code to use the https:// URI scheme instead of
  http://, given the FD forums are enforcing the former now anyway.
  <b>NB: this change will have caused GUIDs to change and thus the last
  7 days worth of posts to re-appear in your feed.</b>
  </p>
  <p><u>2015-06-05 20:00 BST</u><br/>
  I've just changed the RSS generation to output the last 7 days worth
  of posts, rather than the last 100 posts as it was before.  This
  should hopefully avoid any issue in the future with low-frequency
  pollers missing posts due to high dev post rate.
  </p>
  <p><u>2015-05-25 21:15 BST</u><br/>
  Further to the last news post there's also an issue with superscripts
  in posts.  I've not yet time to look into this, but it will do things
  like cause '10<sup>11</sup>' to be collapsed to '1011'.<br/>
  <br/>
  Also, there's a becoming-a-FAQ; "Why don't you show the full post,
  including quotes where present, on each post in the feed?".  The
  answer being:
  <blockquote>Currently the scraping is simple, look at (only the first
  page/initial load of) each users' latest posts on their activity list.
  That's what only contains what I scrape. To get the full posts and
  quotes I'd have to follow each post link, incurring an extra page
  load. As I've already been co-ordinating with the head moderator
  BrettC on ensuring my scraper bot doesn't cause problems with
  hammering the forums, particularly when during those times the forums
  are already under high load, I can't afford to cause that extra load.
  </blockquote>
  </p>
  <p><u>2015-01-27 20:05 GMT</u><br/>
   It's come to my attention that despite claiming utf-8 output the feed
   sometimes attempts to include characters from other encodings.
   Unfortunately the source of the problem is that the FD forums are
   telling my scraper script that they're in iso-8859-1 format but
   allowing characters from windows-1252 encoding through as well.
  </p>
  <p>
   Whilst I could try to hack around this with changing the input
   encoding or doing some search/replace that feels like it will break
   on something else in the future, so for now you'll have to put up
   with the weirdness and blame FD's forum setup for allowing the 'bad'
   characters'.
  </p>
  <p><u>2014-10-25 00:47 BST</u><br/>
   I've now updated my scripts for the new forums.  All looks to be OK,
   although you might have refreshed the feed just as I had a date error
   in it (the cause of which has been found and rectified).
  </p>
  <p>
   If you did then you might fail to pick up new items until one appears
   after Sat, 25 Oct 2014 16:24:00 +0000, depending on how your RSS
   reader acts.
